* MCIGraph Library
The minimalistic graphics library used in the programming 3 course at MCI. The actual library itself is just the ~mcigraph.hpp~ file which is a header only library for ease of use.

An example of how to use it can be seen in ~mandelbrot.cpp~. The folder ~templates~ contains pre-made projects for VisualStudio and Code::Blocks.

The library supports Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

Tile that can be used for creating games are found in the ~tiles~ folder and ~tiles.zip~ archive (the content is identical)

For a more in-depth description of the library see the slides about this topic and the [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLklwMV4rlxFnEd5rem6wm4Cp9xVHYySuy][recordings]].
